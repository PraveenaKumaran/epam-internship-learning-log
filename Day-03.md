## Day 3 – EPAM Internship

### What I did today
- Went through onboarding modules
- Understood my role: Junior Application Support Engineer (Managed Services – Java)
- Explored EPAM learning path modules

### What I learned
- Backend services follow request → process → response flow
- Support engineers need strong debugging skills, not just coding

### What confused me
- Difference between backend developer vs application support
- Why frontend modules are included in backend path

### How I clarified it
- Self-research : Realized frontend knowledge helps in debugging end-to-end issues

### Real-world connection
- If a user reports an error, I need to trace from UI(frontend) → API → DB(backend)

### Questions to ask
- What tools are used for monitoring in our project?
- How are incidents prioritized?

### Tomorrow’s plan
- Start Java Essentials (OOP + exceptions)
